#### Exercises
In this practical we are going to use sample CPI data to practice with analysing and summarising data. This builds on the work you have done in Practical C.

---

1. **Open the workspace icums_22_sample.RData. You need to download this file and put it in the project folder.**


---

2. **piping**

<!-- Using the standard `%>%` and the `%$%` pipes: -->
```{r, echo = F}
boys %>%
  transform(hgt = hgt / 100) %$%
  mean(hgt, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

3. **summarise**

<!-- Using the standard `%>%` and the `%$%` pipes: -->
```{r, echo = F}
boys %>%
  transform(hgt = hgt / 100) %$%
  mean(hgt, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

4. **More summarising**

<!-- Using the standard `%>%` and the `%$%` pipes: -->
```{r, echo = F}
boys %>%
  transform(hgt = hgt / 100) %$%
  mean(hgt, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

5. **merge hs codes**

<!-- Using the standard `%>%` and the `%$%` pipes: -->
```{r, echo = F}
boys %>%
  transform(hgt = hgt / 100) %$%
  mean(hgt, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

6. **something else**

<!-- Using the standard `%>%` and the `%$%` pipes: -->
```{r, echo = F}
boys %>%
  transform(hgt = hgt / 100) %$%
  mean(hgt, na.rm = TRUE)
```
