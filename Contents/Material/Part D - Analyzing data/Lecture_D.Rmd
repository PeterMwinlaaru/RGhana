# This lecture
- Renaming data
- Selecting variables


## More than one element
- Several elements of the same type, e.g. the integers from 1 to 5, can be concatenated into a vector
```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
a
```

- As is typical for `R` there a several ways to accomplish this
```{r}
b <- 1:5
b
```
